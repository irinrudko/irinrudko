### Hey there <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="40">

My name is Iryna Rudzko. I am a software engineer with over 3 years of experience in JavaScript. My primary expertise is React, Redux, and TypeScript. <br/>

I also have substantial experience with Next.js, with a focus on server-side rendering and hands-on experience in testing React applications. Proficient in semantic HTML, CSS3, and pre-processors like SASS, alongside libraries such as Material UI and Radix. In a team, I prioritise clear communication and Agile methodologies, especially Scrum, for a positive and effective work environment.

Recently I’ve transitioned from working with e-commerce applications to my current role in a fintech company. Now I focus on applications with instant data fetching, using tools like React Query and React Table. Beyond coding, I maintain an active lifestyle with a passion for snowboarding, skating, and kayaking. Fluent in both verbal and written English at a C1+ level.
I have a proficient English level (both oral and written), good listening skills and self-control. <br/>
